I've got a feeling inside of me, 
running up through my face.
	Running on through my veins
It's like electrical energy, 
a world about to change.

It's an open road
So here I go
The rest of my life is starting tonight 
Feels like I'm finally on my way 
I'm looking ahead, can't tell where it ends 
But I'm gonna take a leap of faith
And I'm gonna hold on tight 
And ride this ride 
The rest of my life
I'm gonna go for it all out 
I know there's no guarantee 
But I've been given a chance and now 
What's next is up to me
I'm gonna set my sights 
So light those lights
The rest of my life is starting tonight 
Feels like I'm finally on my way 
I'm looking ahead, can't tell where it ends 
But I'm gonna take a leap of faith
And I'm gonna hold on tight 
And ride this ride 
The rest of my life
If all the world's a stage 
I'm here to take my place 
I know I'll always find a way to shine
The rest of my life is starting tonight 
Feels like I'm finally on my way 
I'm looking ahead, 
can't tell where it ends 
But I'm gonna take a leap of faith
The rest of my life is starting tonight 
Feels like I'm finally on my way 
It starts with a dream of who I could be 
Wherever it takes me I can't wait
So I'm gonna hold on tight 
And ride this ride 
The rest of my life 
The rest of my life 
The rest of my life
