# The rest of my life<br />剩下的將來

I've got a feeling inside of me, 
	察覺到內心一種感覺
running up through my face.
	兇猛地來到面前
It's like (a) electrical energy, 
	轟隆隆雷擊般的聲音
a world about to change.
	世界將要改變
It's an open road
	道路沒被封
So here I go
	所以走囉！
The rest of my life, is starting tonight 
	剩下的將來，開始在今晚
Feels like I'm finally on my way 
	感覺靈魂已經歸位
I'm looking ahead, can't tell where it ends 
	我看著前面，好像很遙遠
But I'm gonna take a leap of faith
	但我要深呼吸，並跳躍
And I'm gonna hold on tight 
And ride this ride 
The rest of my life
	剩下的將來
I'm gonna go for it all out 
I know there's no guarantee 
But I've been given a chance and now 
What's next is up to me
I'm gonna set my sights 
So light those lights
The rest of my life, is starting tonight 
	剩下的將來，開始在今晚
Feels like I'm finally on my way 
	感覺靈魂已經歸位
I'm looking ahead, can't tell where it ends 
	我看著前面，好像很遙遠
But I'm gonna take a leap of faith
	但我要深呼吸，跳躍
And I'm gonna hold on tight 
And ride this ride 
The rest of my life
	剩下的將來
If all the world's a stage 
I'm here to take my place 
I know I'll always find a way to shine
The rest of my life, is starting tonight 
	剩下的將來，開始在今晚
Feels like I'm finally on my way 
	感覺靈魂已經歸位
I'm looking ahead, can't tell where it ends 
	我看著前面，好像很遙遠
But I'm gonna take a leap of faith
	但我要深呼吸，並跳躍
The rest of my life, is starting tonight 
	剩下的將來，開始在今晚
Feels like I'm finally on my way 
It starts with a dream of who I could be 
Wherever it takes me I can't wait
So I'm gonna hold on tight 
And ride this ride 
The rest of my life
	剩下的將來
The rest of my life
	剩下的將來
The rest of my life
	剩下的將來
